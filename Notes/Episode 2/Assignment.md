## 1. What is `NPM`?

- npm is a software package manager.
- It is the world's largest Software registry. The registry contains over 800,000 code packages.

## 2. What is Parcel/Webpack? Why do we need it?

- Parcel and webpack are bundlers used for JavaScript or TypeScript code.
- They help minify and bundle code, making it more efficient for deployment.

   - Parcel:
     - Doesn't require external configuration files.
     - Automatically optimizes the entire app for production.

   - Webpack:
     - Requires configuration but offers extensive customization.
     - Allows for code splitting and more fine-grained control over the bundling process.

## 3. What is `.parcel-cache`?

- The `.parcel-cache` folder stores information about your project for faster rebuilds. It prevents re-parsing and re-analyzing everything from scratch.

## 4. What is `npx`?

- NPX stands for Node Package eXecute. It is an NPM package runner.
- It allows execution of any JavaScript Package from the NPM registry without installation.

## 5. Dependencies vs devDependencies

- Dependencies are required for application functionality.
- devDependencies are only needed for development and testing purposes.

## 6. What is Tree Shaking?

- Tree Shaking removes dead (unused) code from a JavaScript application.

## 7. What is Hot Module Replacement?

- Hot Module Replacement allows code changes to be seen in the browser without refreshing, preserving the application state.

## 8. `package.json` vs `package-lock.json`

### `package.json`

- Metadata file describing project details, dependencies, scripts, etc.
- Generated using `npm init` or `yarn init`.
- Contains information like name, version, author, license, and dependencies.

### `package-lock.json`

- Automatically generated by npm.
- Records exact versions of all installed dependencies, including sub-dependencies.
- Ensures consistent, secure, and reproducible builds.

## 9. Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?

- Modifying `package-lock.json` directly can lead to inconsistent and potentially unstable dependency versions.
- It's designed to maintain automatic stability and security in your project.

## 10. What is `node_modules`?

- The `node_modules` folder contains all installed dependencies for the project.
- Usually not committed to version control due to its size.

## 11. What is `dist` folder?

- The `dist` folder is the build output, containing transpiled JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files ready for hosting on a server.

## 12. What is `browserslist`?

- `browserslist` allows specifying which browsers should be supported in your frontend app.
- Configured using "queries" in a config file.

## 13. Difference between ^ (caret) and ~ (tilde)

### Caret (^) Notation

- Compatible with version.
- Updates to all future minor/patch versions within the same major version.
- Provides backwards-compatible new functionality.
- Example: ^1.0.2

### Tilde (~) Notation

- Approximately equivalent to version.
- Updates to all future patch versions within the same minor version.
- Provides bug fix releases.
- Example: ~1.0.2
